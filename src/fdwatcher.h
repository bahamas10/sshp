/*
 * FdWatcher - File Descriptor Watcher Interface.
 *
 * Watch File Descriptors for readable events.  This interface wraps epoll or
 * kqueue to expose a higher-level abstraction to watch for fds to become
 * available (ready to be read).  A simple example looks like this:
 *
 * ```
 * #include <err.h>
 * #include <stdio.h>
 *
 * #include "fdwatcher.h"
 *
 * // can store anything in this
 * struct fd_ev {
 *	int fd;
 * };
 *
 * int
 * main()
 * {
 *	struct fd_ev tevent; // trigger event to watch for
 *	void *events[5];     // events seen by fdwatcher_wait
 *	FdWatcher *fdw = fdwatcher_create();
 *
 *	if (fdw == NULL) {
 *		err(3, "fdwatcher_create");
 *	}
 *
 *	tevent.fd = 0;
 *	if (fdwatcher_add(fdw, tevent.fd, &tevent) == -1) {
 *		err(3, "fdwatcher_add stdin");
 *	}
 *
 *	while (1) {
 *		int nevents = fdwatcher_wait(fdw, events, 5, -1);
 *		printf("fdwatcher_wait saw %d events\n", nevents);
 *		for (int i = 0; i < nevents; i++) {
 *			struct fd_ev *event = events[i];
 *			printf("-> event seen on fd %d\n", event->fd);
 *		}
 *		break; // just for this example
 *	}
 *
 *	fdwatcher_destroy(fdw);
 *	return 0;
 * }
 * ```
 *
 * yields:
 *
 * $ echo hello | ./test-fdwatcher
 * fdwatcher_wait saw 1 events
 * -> event seen on fd 0
 * $
